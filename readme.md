> Example: If the program has the following players (Name: Lebron, Team: Lakers), (Name: Giannis, Team: Bucks), (Name: Kyrie, Team: Nets), (Name: Kevin, Team: Nets) and the following search is made:
>
> 1. User does search with characters "et", the program should print details of Kyrie and Kevin as their team name "Nets" has the characters "et"
